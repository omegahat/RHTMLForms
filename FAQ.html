<h1>FAQ for the RHTMLForms Package</h1>

<dl>
  <dt> The default values are not being read correctly from
      the HTML document. The elements have default values
      visible in both the browser and the HTML document.
      But when we create the function, they are not there.
  <dd>
      The problem is most likely to be not entirely correct,
      but colloquial,  HTML.
      Often people use attributes such as 
      <b>checked</b> or <b>selected</b> by itself rather than
      specifying a value. For example,
<pre>
      &lt;option name="foo" selected&gt;

      &lt;input type="radio" name="bar" checked&gt;
</pre>      
      The HTML parser in some versions of libxml
      does not handle this in the way we might want.
      (It is technically incorrect, so it is not really a bug in libxml.)


  <dt>
      When I create a function from a form and call it, I keep getting
      back the same page!
      
  <dd>
      The URI <a
      href="http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/cgi-bin/goStat.pl">http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/cgi-bin/goStat.pl</a>
      exhibits this behavior. From what we have deduced, we need to
      include  the Submit form element in the <code>POST</code>ing of
      the form. Then and only then do we get back the correct answer.
